Git Practice Repository
This repository is created to practice and explore various Git features, including commits, branches, merges, rebases, and more.

What I'm Practicing:
Initializing a Git repository (git init)
Cloning a repository (git clone)
Staging and committing changes (git add, git commit)
Creating and switching branches (git branch, git checkout, git switch)
Merging branches (git merge)
Rebasing (git rebase)
Resolving merge conflicts
Working with remote repositories (git push, git pull, git fetch)
Undoing changes (git reset, git revert, git stash)
Inspecting history (git log, git diff)
How to Use This Repository:
Clone this repository:
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
Create a new branch and switch to it:

Make changes, stage, and commit:

git commit -m "Practicing Git features"
Push changes to the remote repository:
